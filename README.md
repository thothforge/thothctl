# Thoth Framework

![ThothCTL MCP](./docs/img/framework/thothctl_mcp.png)

Thoth Framework is a framework to create and manage the [Internal Developer Platform](https://internaldeveloperplatform.org/what-is-an-internal-developer-platform/) tasks for infrastructure, devops, devsecops, software developers, and platform engineering teams aligned with the business objectives:

1. [x] Minimize mistakes.
2. [x] Increase velocity
3. [x] Improve products
4. [x] Enforce compliance
5. [x] Reduce lock-in

## Mapping Mechanisms 
| Business Objective | Mechanism          | Implementation |
|-------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| Minimize mistakes | Meaninful defaults | Templates      |
| Increase velocity | Automation         | IaC Scripts    |
| Improve products | Fill product gaps  | New components |
| Enforce compliance | Restrict choinces  | Wrappers       |
| Reduce lock-in | Abstraction        | Service layers |

Thoth allows you to extend and operate your Developer Control Plane, and enable the developer experience with the internal developer platform trough command line.
