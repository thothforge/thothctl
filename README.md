# Thoth Framework

![ThothCTL MCP](./docs/img/framework/thothctl_mcp.png)

Thoth Framework is a framework to create and manage the [Internal Developer Platform](https://internaldeveloperplatform.org/what-is-an-internal-developer-platform/) tasks for infrastructure, devops, devsecops, software developers, and platform engineering teams aligned with the business objectives:

1. [x] Minimize mistakes.
2. [x] Increase velocity
3. [x] Improve products
4. [x] Enforce compliance
5. [x] Reduce lock-in

## Mapping Mechanisms 
| Business Objective | Mechanism          | Implementation |
|-------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| Minimize mistakes | Meaninful defaults | Templates      |
| Increase velocity | Automation         | IaC Scripts    |
| Improve products | Fill product gaps  | New components |
| Enforce compliance | Restrict choinces  | Wrappers       |
| Reduce lock-in | Abstraction        | Service layers |

Thoth allows you to extend and operate your Developer Control Plane, and enable the developer experience with the internal developer platform trough command line.

# Tools

## ThothCTL

Package for accelerating the adoption of Internal Frameworks, enable reusing and interaction with the Internal Developer Platform. 

# Use cases
- **[Template Engine](template_engine/template_engine.md)**:
  - Build and configure any kind of template
  - Handling templates to create, add, remove or update components
  - Code generation
  
- **Automate tasks**:
  - Create and bootstrap local development environment
  - Extend CI/CD pull request workflow
  - Create documentation for projects (IaC), Generative AI doc generation

- **Check and compliance**:
  - Check project structure
    - DevSecOps for IaC (Terraform, tofu)
      - Scan your IaC terraform,tofu templates
      - Generate reports 
      - Manage inventory and dependencies
      - Review IaC changes and make suggestions (Generative AI)
      
- **Internal Developer Platform CLI**
  - Create projects from your templates
  - Source control setup
  - Scaffold - quickly set up the structure of a project.
  


# Getting Started

```bash
$ thothctl --help
Usage: thothctl [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  ThothForge CLI - The Internal Developer Platform CLI

Options:
  --version                  Show the version and exit.
  --debug                    Enable debug mode
  -d, --code-directory PATH  Configuration file path
  --help                     Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  check      Initialize and setup project configurations
  document   Initialize and setup project configurations
  generate   Generate IaC from rules, use cases, and components
  init       Initialize and setup project configurations
  inventory  Create Inventory for the iac composition.
  list       List Projects and Spaces managed by thothctl locally
  mcp        Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for ThothCTL
  project    Convert, clean up and manage the current project
  remove     Remove Projects manage by thothctl
  scan       Scan infrastructure code for security issues.

```

## Enabling Command Autocompletion

ThothCTL supports command autocompletion to make it easier to use. To enable it:

```bash
# Install the package
pip install thothctl

# Run the autocomplete setup script
thothctl-register-autocomplete

# Follow the instructions to add the autocomplete configuration to your shell
```

After setting up autocomplete, you can use the Tab key to complete commands, options, and arguments.

For example, you can type `thothctl i<TAB>` and it will expand to `thothctl init`.

## üéØ Recent Improvements - Inventory Command

### **Modern Infrastructure Inventory with Professional Reports** ‚ú®

The `thothctl inventory iac` command has been significantly enhanced with:

#### **üé® Modern HTML Reports**
- **Professional styling** with Inter font and gradient design
- **Responsive layout** that works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Color-coded status badges** for easy identification of outdated components
- **Print optimization** perfect for PDF generation and documentation

#### **üöÄ Unified Version Checking**
```bash
# Before: Confusing multiple flags
thothctl inventory iac --check-providers --check-provider-versions --check-versions

# After: Simple and intuitive
thothctl inventory iac --check-versions
```

#### **üìä Enhanced Provider Analysis**
- **Provider version columns** showing "Latest Version" and "Status"
- **Comprehensive provider tracking** with registry information
- **Automatic provider checking** when version analysis is enabled
- **Provider statistics** in summary reports

#### **Quick Start**
```bash
# Create comprehensive inventory with modern reporting
thothctl inventory iac --check-versions

# Generate professional documentation
thothctl inventory iac --check-versions --project-name "Production Infrastructure"

# CI/CD integration with JSON output
thothctl inventory iac --check-versions --report-type json
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **50% reduction** in command complexity
- ‚úÖ **Professional reports** suitable for business presentations
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced provider analysis** with version tracking
- ‚úÖ **Simplified user experience** with intelligent automation
