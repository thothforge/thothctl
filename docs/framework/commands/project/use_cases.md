# Project Command Use Cases

The `thothctl project` command is designed to support various project management use cases for development teams. This page outlines common use cases and how to implement them using ThothCTL.

## Creating Reusable Templates

Convert successful projects into templates that can be reused across your organization.

```bash
# Navigate to a project that you want to templatize
cd successful-project

# Convert the project to a template
thothctl project convert --make-template --template-project-type terraform
```

This allows you to:
- Standardize infrastructure patterns
- Share best practices across teams
- Accelerate new project creation
- Ensure consistency in your infrastructure

## Bootstrapping New Projects

Quickly create new projects based on proven templates to accelerate development.

```bash
# Navigate to where you want to create the new project
cd projects

# Create a new project from a template
thothctl project convert --make-project --template-project-type terraform
```

This helps you:
- Start new projects quickly
- Ensure adherence to organizational standards
- Reduce setup time for developers
- Maintain consistency across projects

## Migrating Between IaC Frameworks

Convert projects between different Infrastructure as Code frameworks to adapt to changing requirements.

```bash
# Convert a Terraform project to use Terramate for advanced deployment patterns
thothctl project convert --make-terramate-stacks
```

This enables you to:
- Adopt new tools without starting from scratch
- Leverage advanced features of different frameworks
- Modernize legacy infrastructure code
- Implement more sophisticated deployment patterns

## Preparing for Code Reviews

Clean up projects before submitting them for code review to focus reviewers on relevant changes.

```bash
# Clean up the project
thothctl project cleanup

# Commit the changes
git add .
git commit -m "chore: Clean up project for review"
git push
```

This ensures:
- Reviewers focus on actual code changes
- No temporary or generated files are included
- Cleaner diffs in pull requests
- More efficient code review process

## Standardizing Project Structure

Use templates to enforce a standard project structure across your organization.

```bash
# Create a new project with standardized structure
thothctl project convert --make-project --template-project-type terraform
```

This helps with:
- Onboarding new team members
- Ensuring consistent organization of files
- Making projects more maintainable
- Enabling automation across projects

## Preparing for Deployment

Clean up projects before deployment to reduce package size and remove unnecessary files.

```bash
# Clean up the project
thothctl project cleanup

# Package for deployment
tar -czf deployment.tar.gz .
```

This ensures:
- Smaller deployment packages
- No sensitive or temporary files are deployed
- Cleaner production environments
- More efficient deployments

## Creating Environment-Specific Configurations

Use templates with parameterization to create environment-specific configurations.

```bash
# Create a project from a template
thothctl project convert --make-project --template-project-type terraform

# Answer prompts for environment-specific values
# (ThothCTL will prompt for values to replace placeholders)
```

This allows you to:
- Maintain consistent infrastructure across environments
- Customize configurations for different environments
- Reduce duplication of code
- Simplify environment management

## Implementing Compliance Requirements

Use templates to enforce compliance requirements across projects.

```bash
# Create a compliant project from a template
thothctl project convert --make-project --template-project-type terraform
```

This helps with:
- Ensuring security best practices
- Meeting regulatory requirements
- Implementing organizational policies
- Standardizing compliance controls

## Cleaning Up After Testing

Clean up residual files and directories after testing to maintain a clean workspace.

```bash
# Run tests
./run_tests.sh

# Clean up after testing
thothctl project cleanup -cfd test-results,coverage -cfs *.log
```

This ensures:
- Clean workspace after testing
- No test artifacts in version control
- Reduced disk space usage
- Clear separation between test and production artifacts

## Preparing for Handover

Clean up and standardize projects before handing them over to another team.

```bash
# Clean up the project
thothctl project cleanup

# Convert to a well-documented template if needed
thothctl project convert --make-template --template-project-type terraform
```

This helps with:
- Smoother transitions between teams
- Better documentation of project structure
- Removal of personal or temporary files
- Clearer understanding of project components

## Implementing DevOps Best Practices

Use project templates to enforce DevOps best practices across your organization.

```bash
# Create a new project with built-in CI/CD configuration
thothctl project convert --make-project --template-project-type terraform

# The template includes:
# - CI/CD pipeline configuration
# - Testing framework setup
# - Security scanning integration
# - Documentation generation
```

This ensures:
- Consistent CI/CD practices
- Built-in testing and security
- Standardized deployment processes
- Better DevOps adoption across teams

## Managing Multi-Environment Infrastructure

Use Terramate stacks to manage infrastructure across multiple environments.

```bash
# Convert a Terraform project to Terramate stacks
thothctl project convert --make-terramate-stacks
```

This enables:
- Better organization of multi-environment infrastructure
- Reuse of common configurations
- Simplified management of environment differences
- More advanced deployment patterns

## Implementing Infrastructure Patterns

Create templates for common infrastructure patterns to ensure consistency.

```bash
# Create a template for a specific infrastructure pattern
cd reference-implementation
thothctl project convert --make-template --template-project-type terraform

# Later, create a new project using this pattern
cd new-project
thothctl project convert --make-project --template-project-type terraform
```

This helps with:
- Standardizing common infrastructure components
- Implementing proven patterns
- Reducing duplication of effort
- Ensuring best practices are followed
